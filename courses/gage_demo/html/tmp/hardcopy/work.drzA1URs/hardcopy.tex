Welcome to the MAA short course on {\bf  WeBWorK }.
\par 
Here is a synopsis of the tutorial examples presented in this set. They have been designed for learning the PG language, and are not necessarily the best questions to use for mathematics instruction.
\par 
{\bf  1. Hello world example: } Illustrates the basic structure of a PG problem.
\par 
{\bf  2. Standard example:   } This covers what you need to know to ask the majority of the questions you would want to ask in a calculus course.  Problems with text answers, numerical answers and answers involving expressions are covered.
\par 
{\bf  3. Simple multiple choice example: } Uses lists(arrays) to implement a multiple choice question.
\par 
{\bf  4. Multiple choice example: } Uses the multiple choice object to implement a multiple choice question.
\par  
{\bf  5. Matching list example: }
\par 
{\bf  6. True/false example:  }
\par 
{\bf  7. Pop-up true/false example: } Answers are chosen from a pop-up list.
\par 
{\bf  8. On-the-fly graphics example 1: } The graphs are regenerated each time you press the submit button
\par 
{\bf  9. On-the-fly-graphics example 2: } -- Adds some randomization to the first example.
\par 
{\bf  10. Static graphics example: } Presents graphs created on a separate application (e.g. Mathematica) and saved.
\par 
{\bf  11. Hermite graph example: } A particularly useful way of generating predictable graphs by specifying the value and first derivative of a function at each point.  Piecewise linear graphs are also included in this example.
\par 
{\bf  12. HTML links example: } Shows how to link other web resources to your WeBWorK problem.
\par 
{\bf  13. JavaScript example 1: } An example which takes advantage of this interactive media! This one requires students to calculate the derivative of a function from the definition.
\par 
{\bf  14. JavaScript example 2: } A variant of the previous example that generates the example function as a cubic spline so that students can't read the javaScript code to find out the answer.
\par 
{\bf  15. Vector field example } Generates vector field graphs on-the-fly.
\par 
{\bf  16. Conditional question example: } Illustrates how you can create a problem which  first asks an easy question, and once that has been answered correctly, follows up with a more involved question on the same material.
\par 
{\bf  17 Java applet example: } A preliminary example of how to include Java applets in WeBWorK problems.
\par\hrulefill\par 

The primary purpose of WeBWorK is to let you know if you are getting the right answer or to alert
you if you get the wrong answer. Usually you can attempt a problem as many times as you want before
the due date.  However, if you are having trouble figuring out your error, you should
consult the book, or ask a fellow student, one of the TA's or
your professor for help.  Don't spend a lot of time guessing -- it's not very efficient or effective.
The computer has NO CLUE about WHY your answer is wrong. Computers are good at checking,
but for help go to a human.

\par 
Give 4 or 5  significant digits for (floating point) numerical answers.
For most problems when entering numerical answers, you can if you wish
enter elementary expressions such as \(2\wedge3\) instead of 8, \(sin(3*pi/2)\)instead
of -1, \(e\wedge (ln(2))\) instead of 2,
\((2+tan(3))*(4-sin(5))\wedge6-7/8\) instead of 27620.3413, etc.
 Here's the
{\bf \underline{list of the functions}}
 which WeBWorK understands.
\par 
You can use the Feedback button on each problem
page to send e-mail to the professors. 


 \begin{multicols}{2}

Place the letter of the derivative next to each function listed below: \leavevmode\\\relax 

\par\begin{enumerate}
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}1.] \(\cos(x)\)
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}2.] \(\sin(3x)\)
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}3.] \(3x^5\)
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}4.] \(\sin(2x)\)
\end{enumerate}

\par 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[A.] \(-\sin(x)\)
\item[B.] \(2\cos(2x)\)
\item[C.] \(9x^{2}\)
\item[D.] \(3\cos(3x)\)
\end{enumerate}

\par 

Let's print the questions again, but insist that the
first two questions (about sin and cos) always be included.
Here is a second way to format this question, using tables:
\par 

\par\smallskip\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline

\hbox to .5\linewidth {\hspace{0.5cm}\vbox {
\par\begin{enumerate}
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}1.] \(\sin(x)\)
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}2.] \(2x^3\)
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}3.] \(\cos(x)\)
\end{enumerate}
}} &\hbox to .5\linewidth {\hspace{0.5cm}\vbox {\begin{enumerate}
\item[A.] \(-\sin(x)\)
\item[B.] \(\cos(x)\)
\item[C.] \(6x^{2}\)
\end{enumerate}
}} \\ \hline 


\end {tabular}\end{center}\par\smallskip

\par 
And below is yet another way to enter a table of questions and answers:
\par 

    
\par\smallskip\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline

    \hbox to .5\linewidth {\hspace{0.5cm}\vbox {

\end{enumerate}

We have developed other ways to specify graphs which are to be created 'on the fly'. 
All of these new methods consist of adding macro packages to WeBWorK.  Since they
do not require the core of WeBWorK to be changed, these enhancements can be added by
anyone using WeBWorK.

 These two piecewise linear graphs were created by specifying the points at the nodes.

Linking to other web pages over the internet is easy. For example,

 {\bf \underline{Ivars Peterson's column on the MAA site}}.

All of the files in the html directory of your WeBWorK course site can be read
by anyone with a web browser and the URL (the  address of the file). This is a good
place to put files that are referenced by more than one problem in your WeBWorK course.
\par 
Here is the link to 
the 
{\bf \underline{to the calculator page}}

Match the following equations with their direction field. 
Clicking on each picture will give you an
enlarged view.  While you can probably solve this problem by guessing,
it is useful to try to predict characteristics of the direction field
and then match them to the picture.
\par 
Here are some handy characteristics to start with --
you will develop more as you practice.
\par 

\begin{enumerate}
\item[A.] Set y equal to zero and look at how the derivative behaves along the x axis.
\item[B.] Do the same for the y axis by setting x equal to 0
\item[C.] Consider the curve in the plane defined by setting y'=0
   -- this should correspond to the points in the picture where the
   slope is zero.
\item[D.] Setting y' equal to a constant other than zero gives the curve of points
   where the slope is that
   constant.  These are called isoclines, and can be used to construct the
   direction field picture by hand.
\end{enumerate}

        

        
\par\begin{enumerate}
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}1.] \(y'= 2y + x^2e^{2x}\)
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}2.] \(y'= e^{-x} + 2y\)
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}3.] \(y'= 2\sin(x) + 1 + y\)
\item[\mbox{\parbox[t]{3ex}{\hrulefill}}4.] \(y'= -2 + x - y\)
