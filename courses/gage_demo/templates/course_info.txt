    Click on the name of a problem set (e.g., <em>Orientation</em> or
<em>Calculus_I</em>) to view its problems.
    Similarly, click on the name of a problem to view your version of it and to
be able to have your answers checked
(and <strong>scored</strong> provided the set's due-date is in the future).

If you <em>are</em> either <strong>profa</strong> or <strong>profb</strong>,
then you are an instructor and can work as an instructor for this course.
An instructor can do more things while viewing a problem, e.g., edit it,
view answers and solutions before the answer-date.
The instructor menu of available commands is longer than the student menu, e.g.,
an instructor can use the <em>Hmwk Sets Editor</em> to open a problem set
(experiment: Import from either <strong>setVarious.def</strong> or
<strong>setCalculus_II.def</strong>).
