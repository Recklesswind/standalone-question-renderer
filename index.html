<p>
Create a webservice that connects the PG renderer described below and connect it to the 
web via a ruby webserver.  
</p>

<p>
Create a ruby client to communicate with it. 
</p>

<p>
On url /render_ww_question  webserver  will take input from the client using JSON or XMLRPC protocol,
pass the data to the PG renderer through a file, run the PG renderer on the file and pass the file generated by
this process back to the client.
</p>

<p>
The client must be able to generate the message for the websever, send it to the webserver, receive the
response, format the response from JSON/XMLRPC to HTML print this to an html file. Submit this file 
to a browser.
</p>

<p>
After reading the file the browser will contain a form whose action url points to url /check_ww_question 
on the webserver. The script attached to this url translates the HTML form back into JSON/XMLRPC, 
submits it  to the /render_ww_question url and  passes the reply back to the browser.  
This browser to /check_ww_question cycle can be repeated -- the client is not involved in this part
of the cycle.

<h1>standalone-question-renderer</h1>

<p>This isolates the features of WeBWorK which simply render a problem, 
independent of any connection with a database or with a webserver. </p>

<h2>Required</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>This application uses some extra modules from CPAN which may not be available in your local perl installation. 
The script   <code>bin/check_modules.pl</code> will tell you 
which ones you are missing (for the full WW installation).  The file <code>bin/extras</code> lists the ones I needed to add to get this to work.  YMMV</p></li>
<li><p>This example uses jsMath to display equations so you may need to have that installed to see the equations typeset.</p></li>
</ol><h2>To use</h2>

<p>(1) To see the generator in operation use these commands in the top directory:</p>

<pre><code>run_problem_generator.pl 1&gt;tmp.html 2&gt;warnings
open tmp.html
</code></pre>

<p>A lot of extraneous warnings are created.  I'll try to clean those up soon.</p>

<p>(2) To generate data for input to the question-render</p>

<pre><code>cd clients
./renderProblem2.pl input.txt
ls
</code></pre>

<p>you will see</p>

<pre><code>data_server_to_client.txt   input.txt renderProblem2.pl     renderProblemOutput1.html
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>data_server_to_client.txt</code> file contains the 
code needed for input to the question renderer. Place it in the <code>data</code> directory.  The other files there show sample outputs created while building this application.
The <code>renderProblemOutput1.html</code> file is produced and fed
to a browser.</p>

<h2>Variations</h2>

<p>There are several different pretty print output formats
that can be chosen in <code>RenderProblem.pm</code>.  </p>

<p>The input and output files are currently hardwired in <code>renderProblem2.pl</code> and <code>RenderProblem.pm</code></p>

<h2>To Do</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Track down the warnings and fix them. Many are warnings from PG macros.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue to rework the configuration used in defineProblemEnvir  so that it is modular and can be adapted for both this stand alone generator and for a full fledged WeBWorK site.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it easier to switch output formats and input files.</p></li>
<li><p>Rename the client <code>renderProblem2.pl</code> to something less confusing.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at the various "2" versions in particular <code>Local2.pm</code> and see if its possible to adapt them to use the standard <code>Local.pm</code> file -- possibly modifying the latter.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the ability to handle images mode by adding a small database of some kind.</p></li>
</ol><h2>Project</h2>

<p>Put a Ruby webserver front end on this so that the client
send a .pg file, have it rendered and returned to the client which pushes it through a browser.  The problem in the browser is active in the sense that if the submit button is pressed the entered answers are checked and a new version of the question with answers checked is returned to the browser.</p>

<p>You can use <code>https://hosted2.webwork.rochester.edu/</code> as a webserver for testing if you don't have a local host installed.</p>
